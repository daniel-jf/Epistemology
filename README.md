<h2>About Epistemology</h2>
So, what is Episetmology? Epistemoloy is the study of knowledge. Within knowledge there are four main learning styles: Visual, Audio, Kinesthetic, and Reading/Writing. This app was made with the intention that students will be able to learn the same content in whatever way their learning styles allows them to. However, more specifically with STEM. STEM is something that requires a lot of time and for most, they aren't able to focus that long. This app will help with that!

<li> Styling with bootstrap in React was a challenge because some files edited others if the css was on a higher level, which wasn't expected </li>
