- Methods/Tech Used:
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node
* React
* Bootstraps
* HTML 
* CSS

- Challenges/Stretch Goals
* I want to create a student view and teacher view so teachers can post lessons for students to view when they log in
* Have students show progress on their lessons 
* Styling with bootstrap in React was a challenge because some files edited others if the css was on a higher level, which wasn't expected
